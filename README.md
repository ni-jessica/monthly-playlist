I love music and using it as a form of digital scrapbooking. 

This app authenticates with Spotify and compiles user data to get your top 20 most listened to tracks this month, as well as 10 similar songs, and creates a playlist with a total of 30 songs that is automatically added to your profile.

It also reccomends an album, an artist, and a song to check out for your next month of listening.

This was created with React, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, and the Spotify for Developers API.
