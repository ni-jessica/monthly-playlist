I love music and using it as a form of digital scrapbooking. 

This app authenticates with Spotify and compiles user data to get your top 20 most listened to tracks from the last 30 days, as well as 10 similar songs, and allows you to generate a 30-song playlist that is automatically added to your profile (1 for each day, give or take).

Created with React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and the Spotify for Developers API.
